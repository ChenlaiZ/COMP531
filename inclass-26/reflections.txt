• What did you hope to learn but did not?
  No

• What did you really enjoy learning about?
  I once thought we would only learn about front end in this course. I enjoy the full stack application development very much.

• What worked well in the course? and how?
  1. We covered every topic that may use in full stack application development in the course.
  2. The in-class exercises really help me a lot in understanding the course materials 

• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
  We talked about too many topics. Maybe talk important topics first, and give introductory courses next would be better.

• What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
  exercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
  Give an outline of what would be covered in each class

• Anything else you like to say?
  Thank you Scott
