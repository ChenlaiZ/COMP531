1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
   Jiahui Ruan's presentation about "Bowserify v.s. Webpack" was the most polished and delivered.
   Because the presentation presented a problem first, and introduces the available methods to handle the problem.
   Besides that, he also compared among all the available methods in different aspects.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
   I learned most from Junru Xia's topic --- user experience.
   Before her persentation, I only know user experience is a concept, or just a feeling generated during using the
   product. From her persentation, I knew what user experience consists of, and how different aspects affects user
   interface. This will inspire me to know more about the details of user interface before I develop my own product.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
   I like Chenlai Zhang's talk best. He has a louder vioce than other presenter. He slides is very clear, so I can 
   follow his talk closely. From his talk, I have a brief idea on the features of backbone.js and the pros and cons
   of it. Therefore, I like his talk best.
