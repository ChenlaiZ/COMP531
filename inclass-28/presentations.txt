1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
Chunxiao's Presentation about "redis vs memcached" was the most polished and delivered.
First, her ppt slides are very clear and interesting. Her explanationa along with the 
figures and words on her slides help me understand both pros and cons of redis and memcached. 

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
I learn most from the talk about semantic Web. The presenter talk very fast, and covered all 
the things in his outline. I nearly understood all that he talked about.


3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
I like Qianyi Wu's talk on "A Brief Intro to TypeScript" the best.
He clearly explained the reason why TypeScript exists, what TypeScript offers, and fully 
discussed on why and why not use TypeScript. I felt that I learned a lot from his
five minutes only talk.
